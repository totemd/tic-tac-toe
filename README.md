# tic-tac-toe

This small project is part of The Odin Project's course series on Javascript. This course in particular focuses on factory functions and module patterns.

Two parts of the code are from other sources :
- The CSS customization of the "select" elements (I'm still unsure if I have fully grasped this aspect, so it still is a brutal copy of the tutorial) ;
- The minimax algorithm.

The logic may look circumvoluted (I could have done it without defining a Cell object, for example), but the goal here was to :
- Play with module patterns ;
- Make the code as readable as possible (although I may have over-commented).

Some concepts I feel are still unclear to me :
- Callback functions ;
- Although I think I understood "how" to use factory functions and module patterns, I still feel the need to see "why" they are important ;
- CSS. Yeah, the whole thing, grid, flex, and so on. I did not reach the CSS course yet, though.

Things that my present self thinks my future self may improve :
- Add some randomness to the impossible AI, maybe add an intermediate level ;
- Add a little timeout for AI turns ;
- Display the winning row/column/diagonal ;
- The UI, I like it sober but I still don't have the tools to make it nicer...

I welcome any feedback to help me improve and learn !
